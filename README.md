# PRPGEngine
PRPG is a game engine I am coding in order to learn the python language (v3.) It will be an rpg game maker where everything is based on a d100 probability skill system. If you're skill is 20, a d100 roll of 20 or better would be a success, representing the probability that you would succeed in using that skill 2 times out of 10. 

It current consists of the following modules:
dice.py - This module contains all the dice that are used for the roll mechanics of the game.

rooms.py - This module handles rooms, the spaces in which objects (including the player) can reside.

objects.py - This module handles objects, which are every item in the game--including characters such as the player--that is not
            a room or a game mechanic.

This project was created using the Raspberry Pi.
